# Raindrop Demos - Reddit Community Projects

This repository contains a collection of applications built with the Raindrop platform in response to requests from Reddit communities. Each project demonstrates rapid full-stack development using AI-powered tools and modern cloud platforms.

## Repository Structure

This is a **multi-project repository** designed for Cloudflare Pages deployment:

- **Root Landing Page**: `/index.html` - Showcases all available demos
- **Individual Projects**: Each demo has its own subdirectory with frontend and backend
- **Clean URLs**: Configured redirects for user-friendly navigation (`/project-name`)
- **Shared Resources**: Common deployment configuration and documentation
